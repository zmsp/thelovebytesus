## Ideal story goal
Jobair went ahead and created the website and began his journey. He visited posts, read stories, and kept track of the people he met. He also kept a diary of his experiences and the lessons he learned along the way.

As the weeks and months went by, John continued his journey and eventually found someone he wanted to get to know better. By the end of 2023, John had found the perfect match for him.

Jobair's website was a huge success and he was able to find the right person just by using technology and data. He was able to find the perfect match with the help of his website, and the experience has changed his life forever.


## Why the site was created?
This is still a work in progress as I am brainstorming ideas. Some potential goals are. 

- To help people find someone who is compatible with them 
- To provide a platform for people to connect with each other 
- To provide an easy way to track the progress of each individualâ€™s search 
- To provide an easy way to keep track of the various contacts made throughout the process 
- To help individuals identify and target potential partners 
- To create a database of potential matches 
- To allow people to easily search for compatible partners 
- To provide a medium for individuals to communicate with each other without having to meet in person 
- To help individuals make informed decisions when searching for a compatible partner 
- To provide a safe and secure environment to find a partner
