still drafting-- 

Altogether, I have had 6 notches in my belt after asking around (friends or otherwise) and a lot more no's than yes's when I tried my luck. Compared to the amount of presidents named Bush, I've had fewer successful long-term relationships.


# Summary 
* Total successful relationship created after talking (friends or otherwise): 6
* Total failures: Not that many
* Total people I haven't asked: Many
* Total successful relationships compared to the number of presidents named Bush: Less

Lesson: better to talk then dont.
