still drafting-- 

Altogether, I have had 6 notches in my belt after asking around (friends or otherwise) and a lot more no's than yes's when I tried my luck. Compared to the amount of presidents named Bush, I've had fewer successful long-term relationships.


# Summary 

* Total failures: Not that many
* Total people I haven't asked: Many




I'm going to keep track of how many people I meet on 2023 who would are willingly want to share my interactions.
